% Butterworth Lowpass filter designed using FDESIGN.LOWPASS.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = 361;  % Sampling Frequency

N  = 5;      % Order
Fc = 90.25;  % Cutoff Frequency

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its BUTTER method.
h  = fdesign.lowpass('N,F3dB', N, Fc, Fs);
Hd = design(h, 'butter');
