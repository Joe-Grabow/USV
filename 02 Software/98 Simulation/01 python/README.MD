## Simulation Model

Simple simulation model for the ship dynamics of a catamaran with two identical drives. In addition to the initial conditions x0, y0, vx0, vy0, phi0, and omega0, friction in the x-direction, y-direction around the axis of rotation, as well as water flow and wind drift can be taken into account.

The example calculation includes the following parameters:

| Ship mass | Moment of inertia | Friction x | Friction y | Torsional friction |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| m         | Js                | kx         | ky         | kt                 |
| 100 kg    | 10 kgmÂ²           | 40 kg/s    | 80 kg/s    | 5 Nsm              |

**Starting point:** X = 1m; Y = 1m

- no wind drift
- no water flow
